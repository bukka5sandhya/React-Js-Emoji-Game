When an Emoji is clicked,



If it is not the same as any of the previously clicked emojis, then the Score should be incremented by one

If all the emojis are clicked exactly once

Won Game view should be displayed

If it is the same as any of the previously clicked emojis

Lose Game view should be displayed

If the score achieved in the current game is higher than the previous scores then the Top Score should be updated accordingly

When the Play Again button is clicked, then we should be able to play the game again

The Score value should be reset but not the Top Score value

The EmojiGame component receives the emojisList as a prop. It consists of a list of emoji objects with the following properties in each emoji object

Things to Keep in Mind

All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.

Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.

Do not remove the pre-filled code
